## 📌 Project Overview

This C++ console-based application simulates an **Online Shopping Cart System** where users can act either as **Sellers** or **Customers**. It offers a simple, menu-driven interface operated through numeric selections in the terminal.

The system supports:
- **Sign-up and login** functionality for both sellers and customers  
- **Role-based access** to different features (case-sensitive login required)  
- **File-based data storage** (ensure you have supporting files for full functionality)
